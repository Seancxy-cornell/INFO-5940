## AI Tool Usage
- **DeepSeek**: I have consulted DeepSeek multiple times so that I can get conceptual understanding of RAG architecture and LangChain. components
- **ChatGPT**: I also consulted Chatgpt so that I can get the insights of parameter optimization guidance and code structure suggestions.

## External Resources  
- LangChain documentation
- Streamlit documentation  
- Instructor's Jupyter notebook examples and code patterns

## Original Work
- Complete Streamlit User InterfaceI implementation
- Extend upload functionality to accept both .txt and .pdf files
- The app keeps track of the entire chat so that the conversation can continue naturally
- Integration of instructor's code patterns with extended functionality

## Academic Integrity
AI tools were used for educational purposes to enhance technical understanding. All code implementation, parameter decisions, and system design are my own work based on course materials.
